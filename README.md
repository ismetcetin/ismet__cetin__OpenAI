# Getting Started with Fun with AI
Fun with AI is a web application that helps you to complete or generate text based on your input. You input some text as a prompt, and the application will generate a text completion that attempts to match whatever context or pattern you gave it. For example, if you give the API the prompt, "As Descartes said, I think, therefore", it will return the completion " I am" with high probability.

It's simply a text box where you can submit a prompt to generate a completion. Once you click the submite button after typing your prompt, the app will recive a response and generate a card below the <b>Response</b> header.

Give it a try by clicking [here](https://ismetcetin-openai.netlify.app/) or copy `https://ismetcetin-openai.netlify.app/` and paste it to your web browser to try it.
